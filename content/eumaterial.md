This Review of Materials Modelling describes modelling of materials, their properties and use in industrial applications illustrated by H2020 LEIT NMBP Materials projects. The future of the European industry is associated with a strong modelling capacity. An efficient modelling approach is needed to shorten the development process of materials-enabled products. This Review of Materials Modelling shows that industry is a very active player both in modelling for production and in modelling research areas. Industry identifies the specifications for material properties and the modelling then finds which material composition can meet the specs and how production can be done. This "Materials by Design" approach has been supported during the last decade in the EU Framework Programmes. Application areas of modelling span all industrial sectors. The bulk of the projects are applying existing models to new materials, which shows that the current state of the art of modelling can be characterised as "mature".
