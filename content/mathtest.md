Summary: Latex rendered using MathJax

Theres a useful plugin for Pelican to render Latex equations, called *render_math*. Here are a couple of equations to test that it works okay.

An equation can be placed in-line, by placing Latex code between a pair of `$` characters. Pythagoras' theorem states that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

Alternatively, a pair of `$$` characters can be used to include a display equation. The well known formula to determine the roots of a quadratic equation is:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
