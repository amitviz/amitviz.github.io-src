Summary: About the author of this blog

I am a chartered engineer with a PhD in computational mechanics.

I've spent time in the aerospace industry, doing analysis of metals and composites, and hacking away in Matlab, Python, Perl, Fortran, Abaqus and probably a few other languages too.

This blog has been started with the intention of consolidating stuff that was on my old Google sites page, Evernote, Google Keep, OneNote and Tumblr. I'll also try to documenting a few things that I'd rather not forget, but who knows where it will end up.
