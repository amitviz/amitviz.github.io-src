The Helmholtz illusion is where a shape can appear elongated as a result of the stripe pattern on it.

The first of these papers, [*Applying the Helmholtz illusion to fashion: horizontal stripes won't make you look fatter*] [helmholtz1], examines the effect of whether people look taller or fatter as the result of vertical or horizontal stripes. The findings match Hermann von Helmholtz's original findings, that horizontal stripes make a shape look taller and narrower than with vertical stripes: this is counter to the modern popular belief that vertical stripes make people look taller! Note the photo of one of the authors at he end of the paper, wearing horizontal stripes: trust the evidence!

The second paper, [*Helmholtz illusion makes you look fit only when you are already fit, but not for everyone*] [helmholtz2], notes that there are some other complications, including that the results of the above kinds of studies have shown inconsistent results. These authors point out that the degree to which a figure looks fitter is correlated with how thin the actual figure is, and in fact, for a fatter figure, the effect of the illusion can be reversed. Intersetingly, they've also noted some hysteresis in their testing: the judgement of whether a figure is fit or fat is partially a function of what the observer has previously seen. So content is important. In the illustration at the end of the article, one of the researchers is wearing vertical stripes! Maybe he thinks he is fat.
