The following papers and links are all on the discovery of the structure of DNA. The papers themselves are relatively short, and even without a chemistry background are surprisingly easy to follow.

[The Discovery of the Double Helix, 1951-1953] [nih]

This site gives a nice overview of the story of the discovery, and some of the resulting drama (both involving the researchers, and outsiders opinions of who should and shouldn't be recognised...).

## Avery, MacLeod and McCarty
[*Studies on the chemical nature of the substance inducing transformation of pneumococcal types*, Journal of Experimental Medicine, Nov 1 1943] [mcmc]

In this work, the authors show that DNA was the carrier of hereditary information, or the "gene", in pneumococcal bacteria. They did this by using chemical means to induce changes in the organism that are then transmitted as hereditary characteristics.

## Franklin and Gosling
[*Molecular Configuration in Sodium Thymonucleate*, Nature, April 25 1953] [fg1]

This is the paper immediately following the Watson and Crick paper below, in which the authors offer their interpretation of an X-ray diagram of a non-crystalline form of sodium thymonucleate fibres. The authors reason a number of conclusions, including that the structure is probably helical, there are prrobably two co-axial molecules, and the positioning of the phosphate groups on the outside of the structure.

## Watson and Crick
[*Molecular structure of nucleic acids*, Nature, April 25 1953] [wc]

This is the famous paper in which the authors propose a structure for DNA (or a salt of DNA). In it, they suggest weaknesses in previously proposed models including models with 3-chains, and models with alternative positioning of the phosphate groups. The diagram in the paper is the diagram that is now familiar as the antiparallel double-helix structure of DNA, and in the conclusions, they note that the pairing of bases on their structure suggests a copying mechanism for genetic material. At this point, the structure is a proposal and the authors note that it should be regarded as unproven.

## Wilkins, Stokes and Wilson
[*Molecular structure of deoxypentose nucleic acids*, Nature, April 25 1953] [w]

Another paper from the same issue of Nature, immediately following the Watson and Crick work. In this, the authors outline the experimental evidence of the helical structure, including an assessment of how the structure forms the recorded X-ray images.

## Franklin and Gosling
[*Evidence for 2-chain helix in crystalline structure of sodium deoxyribonucleate*, Nature, June 25 1953] [fg2]

A couple of months afer the 3 works above were published in Nature, Franklin and Gosling offer evidence of the structure of DNA, by correlating a number of features of the X-ray images to those expected from the structure proposed by Watson and Crick. This includes the double helix structure and helix angle, the dimensions of specific features, and the positioning of phosphate groups.
