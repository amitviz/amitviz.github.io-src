The link between goals and performance

What is the the link between the *difficulty* of a  goal and *performance*? Does an easy or tough goal lead to better performance?

Performance is strongly correlated to *acceptance* of a goal. Why do people accept or reject goals?

Goals direct effort - towards the desired task, and away from undesired tasks.

*Stretch goals* (challenging goals) can and do drive performance. But, they can promote unethical behaviour! People can begin overstating their achievements, to make it appear that the goals are being met.

Stretch goals can also promote dissatisfaction - *we measure our performance against our aspirations*. Falling short of a tough target hurts more than over-shooting a low target - even if the actual performance is higher in the first case. This can cause people to burn out!

## SMART goals
A good framework for effective goals.

* Specific
* Measureable
* Agreed
* Reasonable
* Time bound

The down side is that too much focus on a specific goal can make people lose sight of the vision and values, as well as miss the context of our work. They can promote *tunnel vision*. This is a problem when it limits creativity and learning.

Goals should somehow have link to a *meaning*. This gives people a sense of purpose. The customer can give us a sense of meaning - seeing the product of our work is a motivator.
