Eggs have two main parts: the yolk, and the white. The shell isn't much use for cooking.

## The white

The white of the egg is a suspension of proteins in water. The main role of the egg white in a recipe is to add volume to a bake. This is most obvious when whipping the egg white, to create a foam, though it still has a simiular effect when mixed into a cake batter. By creating bubbles that entrap gas, the volume increases when the gas is heated up.

The use of egg whites is most evident in meringues and soufflés.

The scientific bit is that whipping the egg denatures the proteins, which have hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. So, the denatured protein chains tangle, and hold onto or push away from the water content, forming the foam.

When using eggs to entrap gas, futher stabilizers can be added to help maintain the structure of the foam. Something acidic adds more H+ ions to the mix, thus holding on more tightly to the hydrophilic groups. Lemon juice and cream of tartar can be used to fulfil this function.

Sugar can also be used as a stabilizer. I'm not sure how that works.

## The yolk

The yolk of an egg is mostly fat, and it's the tasty part of the egg. Its use in baking is as an emulsifier, i.e. its ability to hold water and fats together. This is used in, for example, mayonnaise, hollandaise etc.

When an egg yolk is heated, the proteins denature and tangle, to thicken a product. Heat too much, and it forms into lumps, but gently heating, this can be used to thicken a sauce. An example of this is crème pâtissière.

## Why egg yolk messes up an egg white foam

The egg yolk is fatty. Fat molecules are also hydrophobic/philic in places, however they are much smaller than the proteins and unable to interconnect to form a network that eventually forms a foam. As a result, the presence of fat (e.g. egg yolk) prevents the formation of a good egg white foam.
