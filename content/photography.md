# Astrophotography

Use a shutter speed faster than 600/f to avoid star trails.

# Sunny 16

On a sunny day set aperture to f/16 and shutter speed to the 1/ISO for a subject in direct sunlight.

# Moony 11/8/5.6

For moonlit shots, set aperture to 11/8/5.6 for full/half/quarter moon, and shutter speed to 1/ISO.

# Handheld shooting

If you're shhoting hand-held, use a shutter speed faster than 1/f for reduced shake.

# Sunset shots

Meter an area of the sky above the sun (without the sun in shot) then take the shot. Reduce further by 1 stop to make it look like ~1/2 hour later.
