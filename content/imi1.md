The necessity to create and communicate a vision

A vision:

* creates a sense of shared direction and meaning
* creates energy
* defines stretch goals that build confidence

**A vision is the message that is communicated every day --- through language and actions.** It's not the same as a mission statement or slogan!

The questions: 

1. Why do we do what we do? Why do we exist as a team?
2. What does success look like? What do we create for our customers/stakeholders?
3. How must we act to ensure success? What are our values?

## Visionary language
* Refer to fundamental values - not explicitly, but transfer the meaning by means of stories and experiences.
* Rhetorical questions - questions that provoke thought.
* Moral conviction - why do we do what we do? Name the customer to create a link for the team.
* Use inclusive language: "we", "our".
* Repeat the message!

## Non-verbal
* Vary intonation, volume and pitch when communicating!
* Smiling
* Open body posture
