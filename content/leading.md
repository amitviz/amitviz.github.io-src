My references on leadership and people management

Over the last couple of weeks, I've started watching some videos and reading some books on the topic of being a leader in the workplace. The plan is to develop a bit more into a new role I'm in, an extend my own skillset. Over the course of watching and reading these, I'll use this blog to make a few notes for my own reference.

## Videos
The main resources I've been using are on [Coursera] [coursera]. There is a specialization called [Leading People and Teams] [lpt], led by the University of Michigan. The course consists of: 

* [Inspiring and Motivating Individuals] [imi]
* [Managing Talent] [mt]
* [Influencing People] [ip]
* [Leading Teams] [lt]

## Books
The one book I'm reading came up a few times in the Hacker News thread linked below:

* [Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams] [book]

## Websites and links

The original discussion that I used as a source of inspiration, as well as a couple of other links:

* [Hacker News](//news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10395046)
* [90-day plan](//firstround.com/review/this-90-day-plan-turns-engineers-into-remarkable-managers/)
* [Things I wish I was told](//fractio.nl/management/)
