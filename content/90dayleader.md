Summary: A plan to turn an engineer into a leader in 90 days

This [90-day plan] [90dp] has a few tips that I think might be quite a useful target for me. In summary:

* **Day 0** - Accept that this is a different job, with different objectives and responsibilities. Understand where I fit with *my team*, *my peers*, and *my manager*.
* **Days 1-30** - Study! Read up formally about leadership and management. Find a mentor. Don't hide the fact that I'm learning and don't initially know what I'm doing.
* **Days 31-60** - Find a rhythm - a regular schedule. An *event loop* defines what I should be doing daily, weekly and monthly, for my team, the teams projects, processes, and for myself.
* **Days 61-90** - Self assessment. Now I'll know what the job is about, I can ask myself 
    1. Am I any good at this? Have I learnt my teams capabilities, can I see where I'm adding value?
    2. Do I really want this?
