An [enclave] [wiki] is a territory, or a part of a territory, that is entirely surrounded by the territory of one other state. An exclave is a portion of a state or territory geographically separated from the main part by surrounding alien territory (of one or more states).

West Berlin was a famous enclave, of West Germany, surrounded by East Germany.

Enclaves/exclaves don't have to be surrounded entirely by other countries (they can have sea borders), but they're more fun if they do.

[Kaliningrad Oblast] [kgrad] is a fairly large chunk of Russia that sits in Europe, between Lithuania and Poland.

Most enclaves are the result of moving borders, either for political reasons or natural reasons (e.g. the border followed a river which has drifted). There were lots of enclaves between countries such as England and Wales, and between India and Bangladesh.

The most fun enclave is [Nahwa] [nahwa] in the UAE. It is a second order enclave, since it is a territory of the UAE, entirely surrounded by a part of Oman which itself is an enclave within UAE. It isn't the only example of a second order enclave, there are parts of [Baarle-Hertog and Baarle-Nassau] [baarle] in Belgium/The Netherlands that are inside one-another.

While we're here, a reminder that there are two countries that are double-landlocked: that is, landlocked, and surrounded entirely by countries that are themselves landlocked. They are [Liechtenstein] [liechtenstein], surrounded by Switzerland and Austria, and [Uzbekistan] [uzbekistan], surrounded by Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.
