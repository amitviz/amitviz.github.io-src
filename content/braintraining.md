There are a number of "games" available, both casual downloadable games and those that purport to be more "scientific", that make the claim that they are a way to either improve cognitive function, or to decrease the rate of cognitive decline. 

In this fairly comprehensive work, [*Do "brain-training" programs work?*] [bt], a review is conducted of the literature which has previously found countering claims of the efficiacy or otherwise of these games. 

The main conclusion is that brain-training programs have pleny of evidence of improving performance on the brain-training program itself, but less and less evidence of the improvement of performance on other real-world tasks as they get less related to the direct task in the game.

In other words, they're probably bullshit.

It's an interesting work, because it looks not only at the science behind brain training, but at the whole industry and their promotion of the idea that these programs work. Further, it looks at the role of journalists and the media, and policymakers, who can give an air of legitimacy to what is most likely pseudoscience (though it might not have been clear that it was pseudoscience at the time, it should have been clear that the evidence was weak).
