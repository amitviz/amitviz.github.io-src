Bloody Mary is the kids game where it's said that repeating "Bloody Mary" to a mirror a number of times causes her appearance. It turns out that this might be true (at least in some sense)! This article, [*Stranger-face-in-the-mirror illusion*] [bm], suggests that under dim lighting, the face processing capability of the brain takes the traits it can make out, and essentially attempts to fill-in the gaps, causing strange, deformed faces, or faces of unknown people to be observed. However, this is not a complete explanation, since some people see fantastical, monstrous or animal faces which wouldn't be expected to be part of the normal human facial processing mechanism.
