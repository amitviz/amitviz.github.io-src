What drives people to perform?

Performance can be measured by *engagement* - being comitted to the job, and making positive contribution to the team.

*Maslow's hierarchy of needs*: after physical needs, people need a sense of belonging, a sense of self-esteem and a sense of meaning.

* In general, there aren't many differences in motivators across cultures, However, there are across different generations, e.g. the desire for more leisure time.

*Hertzberg's two factor model*: what factors drive satisfaction (motivating factors) and dissatisfaction (hygeine factors)?

* These are *not* opposites of each other: removing the dissatisfaction does not automatically lead to satisfaction. Both should be considered!

*Extrinsic and Intrinsic motivators*:

* **Extrinsic** motivators - things that the organization provides - pay, recognition/titles/status, rewards etc.
* **Intrinsic** motivators - internal, e.g. autonomy, belonging, a sense of meaning.

A poor focus on one without the other can actually be de-motivating. E.g. rewarding people (extrinsically) for an intrinsically motiviating task undermines the performance. 'Pay for performace' works less well than 'pay for engagement'.

Creating meaning at work: linking the work to the customer helps, i.e. seeing the beneficiaries of the work. Outsource motivation!
