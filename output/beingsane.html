    <h1>The Rosenhan&nbsp;Experiment</h1>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>If sanity and insanity exist, how shall we know&nbsp;them?&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1973, psychologist David Rosenhan conducted an experiment to determine the validity of psychiatric diagnosis. He did this by taking a number of sane volunteers, and having them self-admit to psychiatric institutions for having auditory hallucinations. All of the test subjects managed to get in with ease. Once the pseudopatients were in, they behaved normally (i.e. without symptoms), as they were told that they would have to get out on their own, essentially convincing the staff that they were sane. It was found that to be discharged from the facility, the patients all had to admit to having a mental illness, and to take antipsychotic medication. The eight pseudopatients were hospitalized for between 7 and 52 days before they could convince the staff to discharge&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Later, one of the institutions involved in the earlier study challenged the assertion that they could make such an error. They asked Rosenhan to send further pseudopatients which it said it would correcly identify. Rosenhan agreed, and in the following weeks, the staff at the institution identified a number of its new patients as suspicious (i.e. pseudopatients that had no psychiatric issues). The only problem was that Rosenhan hadn&#8217;t sent&nbsp;anyone.</p>
<p>This story was published in Science as <a href="//amit.visrolia.net/pdf/being_sane.pdf"><em>On being sane in insane places</em></a>. It&#8217;s an interesting work, as it identifies that a type 2 error (a false positive) was prevalent in mental health which might be expected, since it&#8217;s normally &#8216;safer&#8217; to diagnose illness than health. However, the second part demonstrated that type 1 errors (false negatives) can also easily be&nbsp;generated.</p>
<p>The general conclusion of the work is that the process of diagnosing someone as sane or insane was massively susceptible to errors. More widely, the experiences of the pseudopatients were that the psychiatric institutions were that being labelled insane (as they were in the institute) resulted in the staff treating them in a particular way, regardless of their specific behaviours and interactions. This included a significant degree of depersonalisation, and together with the structure of the environment and the staff, led to the pseudopatients experiencing powerlessness. This speaks of the attitude in wider society towards those with mental&nbsp;illnesses.</p>
