    <p>The Dunning-Kruger effect is the illusion of superiority that people of low ability make of themselves. In the paper by Kruger and Dunning, <a href="//amit.visrolia.net/pdf/dunning_kruger.pdf"><em>Unskilled and unaware of it: how difficulties in recognizing one&#8217;s own incompetence lead to inflated self-assessments</em></a>, the authors attibute this to the fact that the incompetent are unable to accurately evaluate their own&nbsp;abilities.</p>
<p>In other words, some people can be so stupid, that they don&#8217;t even realise how stupid they&nbsp;are.</p>
<p>The work also suggests the opposite is also true, that people of high ability don&#8217;t recognise their ability, and think that everyone else is equally&nbsp;capable.</p>
<p>The idea of the paper is so wonderfully simple, that it seems obvious: that the skills in any one domain are the same skills necessary to evaluate competence in that&nbsp;domain.</p>
<p>Four studies were conducted, using the domains of humour, logical reasoning (in two of the studies) and grammar. Humour is an unusal thing to apply to a study here, where different jokes were rated by the test subjects, and compared to ratings assigned by a panel of professional comedians. The logic and grammar tests were more conventional, and I believe, stronger ground for building the authors&#8217; case. The second phase of the grammar test asked the subjects to mark other subjects tests: the purpose of this was to determine if subjects were unable to assess just their own level of skill, or even the level of skill in&nbsp;others. </p>
<p>Study 4 is the most interesting: having established the correlation between incompetence and over-evaluation of skills, the authors attempt to manipulate the subjects to establish a causality. They note a paradox here: to make the incompetent realise that they are incompetent, you have to make them competent. The authors did this by repeating the logic test, but gave some of the participants some of the training required to both pass the test and (as hypothesized) to evaluate competence. The finding was indeed that a little bit of training enables people to assess abilities more&nbsp;accurately.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a thorough scientific paper, but I like some of the flourishes in it, such as the opening hook (a story of a bank robber), and occasional quotes (&#8220;Thomas Jefferson once said, &#8216;he who knows best best knows how little he knows.&#8217;&#8221;) that make it an engaging&nbsp;read.</p>
